# Extensible and interoperable science through a 'Serverless' model in the context of SKA

The volume of data obtained by astronomical instruments is increasing, and is expected to reach the exabyte scale in the coming years thanks to instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), among others. Therefore, many of the scientific experiments in astrophysics are necessarily performed in a Big Data context. This poses a challenge for scientists and developers, as most of the data analysis and processing will not be performed on conventional equipment and will be moved to Cloud Computing, HPC or Grid environments. 

A key aspect for scientific breakthroughs will be the implementation of software and tools used in science for data processing. In this project we will study a solution based on a Serverless model. This model involves working with a catalogue of Functions-as-a-Service where the software is executed through APIs, guaranteeing reproducibility and scalability. The user can use these APIs from Jupyter Notebooks or pipelines, without having to deal with the computing infrastructure.

In this Big Data context, the SKA project is paradigmatic. The SKA radio telescope will be the largest scientific infrastructure on the planet, with thousands of antennas spread across Africa and Australia.  Each year it will produce 700 Petabytes of data that will be sent for scientific analysis to the so-called SKA Regional Centres (SRCs). The IAA-CSIC, through the AMIGA group, is the coordinator of the Spanish participation in the SKA project and leads the development of the SRC prototype in Spain, as part of its Severo Ochoa programme.

AMIGA is an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and computer scientists, a reference in the study of atomic gas in galaxies. The selected person will join this international group and contribute to an innovative software catalogue under Serverless. This software will be based on real applications for the analysis of radio interferometer images in order to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the model. In doing so, he will learn about virtualisation, containers, and data processing. The work carried out will be published in a reference journal, where this type of platform and its viability within SKA will be highlighted, following good practices in scientific methodology.

## Concepts to know

### HPC

High-performance computing (HPC) is the practice of using parallel data processing to improve computing performance and perform complex calculations. HPC achieves these goals by aggregating computing power, so even advanced applications can run efficiently, reliably and quickly as per user needs and expectations. It thus delivers much higher power and better performance than traditional computers, workstations and servers.

### Cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Virtual Machines

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.

### Containers

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

### Serverless model

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

## Training

List of tutorials for training.

### VM installation - How to install Ubuntu in a VM

Steps: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox/

The idea with this task is to familiarise yourself with the VM working environment.  The context of this project requires knowledge of Linux, so having a VM with a version of Ubuntu available is useful for all the following training.

### Intro to Linux - Bash/Shell scripts
